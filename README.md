# Local Tourist

## Project Overview
The "Local Tourist" project aims to provide users with personalized sorting of attractions, optimal routes for visiting attractions, and intuitive attraction ranking capabilities. For me, this project serves as a platform for gaining experience in working with cloud deployment, REST API connections, all things database, algorithms, Python, and the Flask framework.

### Key Features
- Attraction searching based on geographical locations.
- Creation and modification of personalized plans for visiting attractions.
- Intuitive personal ranking list for attractions user has been to.
- Generation of optimal trip routes through the Google Maps API. <br>


## Roadmap
These features are planned implementations in future builds:
- Personalized sorting of attractions based on users similarity scores with other users
- Group creation and group trip planning
- AI NLP solution to suggest plans and attractions with automated feature engineering
- Robust testing framework

## Installation
This project is deployed via Google App Engine and can be accessed through this link:

<br> A demo login is username: "test", password: "test," or you may register your own profile for the full experience. 


## Configuration
All configurations are managed through Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Usage
The project is web-based and communicates with multiple APIs, including the Google Maps API. An example usage scenario includes generating the optimal ordering of attractions to visit based on a user-specified list of places.

## Testing
Currently, there are no testing frameworks implemented in the project. They will be coming soon.

## Documentation
API documentation for integrating with Google Cloud Platform and the Google Maps API library can be found at:
