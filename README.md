# Local Tourist

## Project Overview
The "Local Tourist" project aims to provide users with personalized sorting of attractions, optimal routes for visiting attractions, and intuitive attraction ranking capabilities. For me, this project serves as a platform for gaining experience in working with data, algorithms, Python, SQL, the Flask framework, cloud deployment, and REST API connections.

### Key Features
- Personalized sorting of attractions based on user preferences.
- Creation and modification of personalized plans for visiting attractions.
- Generation of optimal routes through the Google Maps API. <br> *CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE DURING DATABASE MIGRATION


## Roadmap
These features are planned implementations in future builds:
- Attractions ranking functionality, allowing users to intuitively rank attractions they have visited.
- Group creation and group trip planning
- AI NLP solution to suggest plans and attractions with automated feature engineering
- Robust testing framework

## Installation
This project is deployed via Google App Engine and can be accessed through this link:
<br> https://tourist-412606.uk.r.appspot.com


## Configuration
All configurations are managed through Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Usage
The project is web-based and communicates with multiple APIs, including the Google Maps API. An example usage scenario includes generating the optimal ordering of attractions to visit based on a user-specified list of places.

## Testing
Currently, there are no testing frameworks implemented in the project. They will be coming soon.

## Documentation
API documentation for integrating with Google Cloud Platform and the Google Maps API library can be found at:
